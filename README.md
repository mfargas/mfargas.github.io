This is an experimental page on GitHub as I self-teach myself to develop websites on various types of launchpads.

GitHub provides a web page hosting service on one general GitHub page. I would like to try this out and familiarize myself with its advantages and complications. I am experimenting on SquareSpace and inMostion Host as well.
